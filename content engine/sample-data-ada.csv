1,"Eat note | Campus Food Court. You see, the campus has so many places to eat it. UC cafeteria is the only non-self-service cafeteria, long-term implementation of the target, service the bustling big day students. UC has five windows cafeteria, lunch and dinner there are salads, sandwiches, live frying staple food, as well as Western-style fast-food chef dishes. Each dish is priced at around five to eight knives and a speed of a few cents per annum. Medium quality of the dishes but not very stable, it really depends on good luck. Note: Please do not try looks strange dishes, repeat, please do not try looks strange dish."
2,"CSC108 CSC148 and the language used is python, CSC108 more emphasis on basic grammar and applications, CSC148 more focused on simple data structures and program logic. Since CSC108 not into professional requirements, so there python or other programming based students can choose to skip CSC108 directly on CSC148, do not waste time (tuition). Of course, CSC108 no programming foundation for, or would like to look over at the first semester of students, it is still a good choice.
CSC108 famous as much water courses, all the fundamentals of programming .coursera above how to do their own CSC108 network class, spend an afternoon all listen to it again to take the final exam (Tracy: Please consider carefully according to their own circumstances. .. do not hit me hanging) csc148 \ 207 respectively python \ java advanced, it involves an algorithm based on test sites more mixed, need to seriously review the exam. you can choose the aspect algorithm csc165 + csc236 or a separate one csc240. Do not think just repair csc240 save time, I can only say that you break the pattern Tucson friends. Almost all the students feel cs csc240 difficult than the sum csc165 and 236.

CSC165 is the basis of mathematical logic, the country participated in the college entrance examination students the basic need to the classroom (both junior high school and some knowledge), Canadian International High School and local high school students may need to add some basic logical proof tools. CSC236 I never heard of, but it is also reflected in the students some basic algorithms and computational science content, in addition to spending some time okay.

Here is the key |||
CSC240 is much famous gpa killer, professor Faith Ellen person of faith goddess, when 100 people at full commencement +46 waitlist final exam to drop, leaving only 30 people in midterm exam out of 33, but gifted lacking a little friends the median value content is not difficult, but the test of time is very tight, and a lot of small traps. usually it takes time for the job will be very long. carefully choose!"
3,"As students of the Department of Mathematics, if you have not seen this picture, that small series can only say something: You're welcome! )

Well, as the Chinese people to learn to do more professional, math elective actually very simple. Pa school version is divided into theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics learning slag Normal Edition.

Let's talk about the theory of mathematics learning Pa develop the road, in fact, do not need elective, as long as you remember that you have to choose each mathematical code like the highest class. (Tracy heart is to see this collapse = =) in order to make such a school bully quantified guidance, I repeat courses. Freshman mat157, mat240, mat247. As a sophomore junior, the people are generally the existence of ghost schools, learning slag had no chance to see them, and they disdain and slag learn to discuss their course, because you must listen! Do not! understand! And the stage is in fact such a school lesson Pa selection of elective rather than people. You will receive an email prof passion invites you to challenge your intellengce. They usually use some thought interesting topic, or they will increase this year avg exaggeration to deceive you into the pit. Of course, the school bully, they just go to the classroom to prof occasionally a little face, and do not need the guidance of prof's own home can 90+.

For applied mathematics, half of the students are eco-related, because it sounds relatively tall on. The other half of the students mingled with CS, BIO, PHY, CHE, there are many amazing professional. So mathematics is not a language but a subject of this sentence is really true. Starting from elective, if your title still under math department, it will certainly be a 137,223,224. In fact recommended to install a pseudo-science to 157 Pa, because you omitted sophomore 246 times. If you can not easily more than 80 137, then quickly turn to other professional sophomore right to continue studying mathematics will not make you happy. 137,223,224 belong Shuafen lesson, if you seek a little GPA, take a moment to get 4.0, because the future opportunities converge to 0. Especially domestic high school classmate, freshman mathematics can not get more than 4.0 to the motherland shame. Besides other professionals, students are forced to learn math, general professional require 137 or 135/136. Many people mistakenly think 135/136 is very simple, in fact, they cover a large number of calculations, the actual exam is far more difficult to get a high score. 137 recommendations try, anyway, what can drop down fear.

Most of the above as a freshman enrollment guidance. Sophomore junior students, basically I have been booked subject POSt, that fact and then study enrollment actually little significance. In short, the lesson is simple Hurry 4.0, difficult lesson to learn as long as the school to Kill undead, choose their own professional pit dug themselves fill it. Finally, we encourage word, 200 level courses in math is basically common mathematical supremum, the completion of 237,257 is basically the brain of your life to develop the most advanced period of time, the big three four classes, especially at the beginning of APM class pay more attention to the application, not the theoretical requirements so strong. After so many sophomore students learn mathematics 237 if you feel tired and do not feel love, then advise you to hold on, the clouds have passed.

Finally, the school bully who say, math class more difficult, but a lot of bonus, idle nothing unexploded explosive sub play good, wholesome month burst a burst. (Tracy wrong, then do not ask him, after the elective TAT)"
4,"BIO120: Adaptation and Biodiversity
Since this course is focused on understanding the principles of biological evolution and phenomena, it will look very much like the liberal arts curriculum. To understand the difficulty of the course content is not high, but wide knowledge, so the class can not let any details of the professor speak. Usually there will be a lot of reading, reading in any of the content are likely to appear in the examination. But personally think that this course is focusing on understanding, no need to remember all the force of knowledge, as long as the master and the fundamental laws of biological evolution and the concepts involved in the examination of the contents have not seen even in the face also it can be inferred out. But then, each exam will BIO120 biased Jidao particularly special topics, such as the vertical axis of a graph, like what lecture on what is mentioned, everyone doing the past test will know. . . So I suggest, the examination time do not stuck on a problem stalled, really I have no idea if they silently turn to the next question, then finish all the questions back to think of this question.

BIO130: Molecular and cell biology
If the high school had biology12, then 130 pairs of you, some of the relatively relaxed. Although there are still a lot of content need to read and remember, but as long as the reading are carefully read, in class professors emphasize knowledge carefully recorded, and when the test can be substantially bon voyage. BIO130 early classes and evening classes are not a professor post (BIO120 by the same professor taught early and evening classes), so a lot of people will go to rub teach better Prof.Yip evening classes, often a packed classroom , many students even stood behind lectures. Of course, do not rub on my friends, do not worry, just listen carefully in class, the same can learn."
5,"RSM100H / RSM100Y


This course is an Introduction to Management. It covers three specialists (finance, accounting, management) all the basics that can be selected after the RC.
This course is no trick, everything is all syllabus content class book +. Before teaching are respectively the upper and lower two semesters each year by the two professors. The first semester by Professor John, more boring lectures, skipped high rate, low average. Responsible for the second semester by Khan (folk called him Khan) is very active in his class, he was able to learn a lot of lessons.

The professor is extremely lazy, the volume and past test is almost the same (to change the title to change the name change is not the full range) so the clubs are relatively high. However, this year has finally change course, the sister school seniors do not really envious of. Sister suggestions, energy in the first half (rsm100H) then do not the previous year (RSM100Y)"
6,"Course Guide to math | may be the most interesting to be pure number vs Number
mat137or157? mat223or240? Department of Mathematics Course guide the conscience. There are ultra Duo Fuli and learning tips Oh! Definition of pure number of rather vague, opening the calendar look, you can find Mathematics and Applied Mathematics freshman courses are required level of pure numbers: MAT157, MAT240 + MAT247

Department of Mathematics, students have the arrogance kinds of bones, especially the pure number, as if living in the discipline despise top chain. But this science is not the legendary cold so high, especially for the students experienced the college entrance examination, is fully capable of easily second child freshman math class.
(For such students, if you have not take the 4.0, I just want to ask:? LOL what extent girlfriend found it?)

Keke ...... that far away, then explain in detail these doors Instrumental Lessons:

MAT157 Analysis


This course is similar to the domestic mathematics (blue textbook), however by observing, mat157 much simpler. The basic content is the theoretical proof version of the calculus. There's nothing calculated, in this regard even as mat137.

The lectures rhythm is moderate, but a lot of work, but as long as careful completion of the exam is not an issue. Several test and final painting style stable, very little biased questions, but still need some mathematical literacy bonus (and there are many hidden bonus, so the possibility of this course is not a small burst point)

Professor Prof.Bierstone is a highly intelligent, affable, popular super grandfather. (When the end of class, I heard students longest, enthusiastic applause) and writing on the blackboard is very clear, not to school to find someone to look at notes can handle (this is wrong, do not imitate) the entire user experience is very good ~

So many advantages, so in the end this course Difficulties?
My personal experience: the final exam a few questions really need to shake clever to do it.

So, if there is one up on the recommendation seniors mat157, please do not take him away at once, or you can make friends ~~"
